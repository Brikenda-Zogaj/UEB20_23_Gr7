        <article class="text">
            <p>Houses, the sanctuary we return to after a long day, hold stories within their walls. They stand as more than just physical structures; they encapsulate memories, emotions, and a sense of belonging.
                 Within these walls, we find comfort, safety, and the freedom to express our truest selves.</p>
